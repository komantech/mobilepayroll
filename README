This is a point of sale system that keeps track of employee hours, contact information, and other company information. It calculates biweekly payroll. There are two parts to this POS system: The web interface and the Android app.

1. The Web Interface
The Web interface can be accessed by the company manager and employees of the company. We will call these two groups admin and non-admin.
	a. Admin Group
		Admin accounts is used to manage company assets, such as employee contact information, payroll, and summary of the company's growth.
	b. Non-admin Group
		Non-admin accounts can only be created through the Android application. When the user is created, a username and password is displayed on the screen for the user to write down. This username and password can be used to log into the web interface. The user can change his personal information and see the amount of hours he worked.


2. The Android App
The Android App is essential to this POS system. It sends live status updates about which employees are currently clocked in and where they are clocked in from.



Conclusion:
This system can be easily expanded to include direct deposit, live gps tracking of the phone thru the web interface, and many more things.
