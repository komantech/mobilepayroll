                      The Home Depot is required by the IRS to furnish all associates with Form W-2 for each calendar year worked.
                      The IRS requires that you consent to receive Form W-2 in an electronic format rather than a paper copy by mail.
                      Please check one of the consent options above and click the &quot;I Agree&quot button.<br /><br /><br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you enroll to receive your Form W-2 electronically rather than by mail, you will receive an announcement, sent to your work location, each January alerting you when your online Form W-2 is available for viewing and printing.
                      The online Form W-2 will display the same information in the same format as the current Federal Form W-2 paper statements including all required copies (employee copy, Social Security Administration copy and state/local copy).
                      You can print your online Form W-2 to attach to your tax return.
                      If you select the &quot;I elect to view/print/receive my W-2 electronically&quot; option, you will not receive a paper Form W-2 by mail; however, you may request a paper copy at any time by selecting the applicable option above or by sending an e-mail or written notice to the address below.
                      You will begin receiving a paper copy of your Form W-2 by mail for any Form W-2 issued after the date of this election.
